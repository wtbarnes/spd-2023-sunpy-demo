## During Presentation ##

We'll be running a Slido to gather feedback in real time from the audience.
With the free plan, we can only have three questions and one being live at a time.
The feedback will be targeted towards the project overall, not necessarily specifically towards the presentation.

Public link is: <https://app.sli.do/event/6GSTGFUgR2PWhSC4gyAbNB>

Questions are currently:

- What do you wish you could do with SunPy but can't?
    - This includes packages within the SunPy ecosystem like aiapy or ndcube.
      We want to figure out what gaps are missing within the Python libraries that are currently available.
- What feedback do you have for the SunPy Project?
- What do you think about SunPy's documentation and examples?


One person will be presenting.
